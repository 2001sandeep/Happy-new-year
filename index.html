    Happy New year Bujji daana….
Thankyou for making my life better simply by being in it, Thankyou for being exactly who you are.May god transform your tears into smiles, pain into strength and worries into happiness.Everything is better with you, Everything has been better since you.I pray that you win in your life, achieve all your dreams, i really wanna see you on top, and become the person you wanted to, I believe in you! It doesn’t matter how many times you say it won’t workout, because i’ll stay with you in every situation. As a man, it brings tears to my eyes to realise how good of a woman i have by my side. And im not ashamed to admit it. I will forever be your biggest supporter. Whatever you do in life, just make sure at the end of the day you are happy, Life is way too short for stress & unhappiness. Honestly, i feel happy when you share even the small stuff with me. Your random thoughts, your silly worries, little wins, boring days, all of it matters to me. It makes me feel close to you, like i actually belong in your life. I like knowing what goes in your mind, even when its nothing special.Even when the world doesn’t clap for you, i will and even without trophy. I’ll always  come running to you just to tell you how proud i am, even of the smallest little things you achieve. I’m Not here to fix you. I’m just here to hand you snacks, forehead kisses, and a safe place to be dramatic until you realise im not going anywhere. Forever the man who will never raise his voice at you and will always be there to reassure you, no matter what.To the bujji woman who criticises herself for still hurting, healing is not late and it it is not wrong. Some days will feel heavy again.That doesn’t erase your progress. Wishing you a happiest, healthiest and wealthiest new year…may god bless you with all the things you deserve..Happy new year!! ♥️ 🫂 💙
